      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Muhammad Owais</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented <strong>Web Developer</strong> with a strong foundation in modern web technologies and a dedication to creating dynamic, responsive, and visually engaging user experiences. With over <strong>20+ completed projects</strong>, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend design, developing everything from simple landing pages to full-scale animated portfolio websites and interactive games.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant and efficient code, and I’m constantly pushing myself to learn new tools, libraries, and frameworks that elevate the user experience. Whether it's a pixel-perfect UI clone like the <strong>BBC website</strong>, a full-fledged <strong>eCommerce platform</strong> with cart functionality, or a fun <strong>Flappy Bird Game</strong> developed in JavaScript, I aim to build projects that are not only functional but also immersive and smooth.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in UI/UX design principles and performance optimization. I care about accessibility, responsive design, and smooth animations that bring web pages to life. My projects often include <strong>theme switching</strong> features, professional layouts, clean typography, and intuitive interactions — all of which reflect my focus on quality and user experience.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I'm currently looking to collaborate with innovative teams or clients who are passionate about building great products. My goal is to continue growing as a developer while contributing to real-world solutions that make a difference.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch via the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. Let’s build something amazing together!
